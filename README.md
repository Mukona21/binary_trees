# Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree Project

This project focuses on understanding and implementing concepts related to binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs). The main objective is to gain a solid understanding of these data structures and their associated algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain the concept of a binary tree and its properties.
- Differentiate between a binary tree and a binary search tree (BST).
- Understand the advantages of using binary trees over linked lists in terms of time complexity.
- Define and differentiate between the depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
- Implement various methods to traverse a binary tree: in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order traversals.
- Identify different types of binary trees: complete, full, perfect, and balanced.

## Project Structure

- The `binary_trees.h` header file contains the function prototypes for the binary tree and binary search tree operations.
- The source files (`*.c`) contain the implementations of the functions.
- The `main.c` files can be used for testing the functions, but you don't need to push them to your repository.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Code should follow the Betty style guidelines.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Use of the standard library is allowed.
- Header files should be include guarded.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Implement the required functions in the source files (`*.c`).
3. Ensure your code follows the Betty style guidelines.
4. Compile the code using the provided compilation options.
5. Test your functions using your own test cases or the provided `main.c` files (if needed).

## Example Compilation

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -o binary_tree binary_tree.c main.c
```
